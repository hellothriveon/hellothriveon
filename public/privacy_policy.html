      <p class="mt-8 text-lg">Your privacy is the foundation of our service. We understand that you are trusting us with
        deeply personal information, and we are committed to protecting that trust. This policy explains in plain
        language what information we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have over your data. Our goal is to be
        transparent and to give you complete control.</p>

      <h2>Our Privacy Promise</h2>
      <p>Our entire business is built on these three principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. You Own Your Data, Always.</strong> The thoughts, feelings, and memories you share within
          ThriveOn are yours. You can export or delete your data at any time. We are simply custodians of your
          information.</li>
        <li><strong>2. We Use Bank-Level Security.</strong> All data is encrypted when it's being transmitted (in
          transit) and when it's stored on our servers (at rest). We use industry-best practices to protect your
          information from unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>3. We Have a Clear Business Model.</strong> We are a subscription service, not a data company. We
          will never sell, rent, or share your personal data with third-party advertisers or data brokers. Our success
          depends entirely on earning and keeping your trust, not on monetizing your information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect basic information like your
          name and email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Content:</strong> We collect the information you and your AI agents generate within the app.
          This includes journal entries, responses to prompts, scheduled events, and any other content you create while
          using the service. This information is necessary for the AI agents to function and provide you with support.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect non-personally identifiable information about how you interact with
          our service. This includes things like which features you use most often and when you use the app. We use this
          data to understand what's working, fix what's not, and improve the overall experience. We do not track your
          activity outside of the ThriveOn app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Improve the Service:</strong> We use your information to operate the AI agents,
          personalize your experience, and develop new features that make the service more helpful.</li>
        <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> We may use your email address to send you important updates about
          your account, security notices, or changes to our policies. You can manage your communication preferences in
          your account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security and Safety:</strong> We use information to protect against fraud, abuse, and security
          risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
      <p>We do not share your personal data, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third-party companies to help us operate our
          service (e.g., cloud hosting providers like Amazon Web Services). These providers are contractually obligated
          to protect your data and are not permitted to use it for their own purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe it's required by law,
          such as in response to a subpoena or court order. We will attempt to notify you before disclosing your
          information in response to a legal request unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>We retain your information for as long as your account is active. You have the right to delete your account at
        any time. When you delete your account, we will permanently and irreversibly delete all of your personal
        information and content from our systems within a specified period (e.g., 30 days), except for any data we are
        legally required to retain.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>You have control over your personal information. You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Correct any inaccurate information.</li>
        <li>Request the deletion of your account and all associated data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can exercise these rights directly within your account settings or by contacting us at the email below.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>ThriveOn is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child, we will take steps to delete that
        information immediately.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by
        email and/or through a prominent notice within the app before the changes take effect. We encourage you to
        review this policy periodically.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about this policy or our privacy practices, please do not
        hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@thriveon.ai">privacy@thriveon.app</a>.</p>
