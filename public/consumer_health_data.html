                    information for yourself or another person.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Sources of Consumer Health Data</h2>
            <p>
                We collect the Consumer Health Data listed above directly from you when you voluntarily provide it
                through your use of the ThriveOn Platform.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Purpose of Collection and Use (Why We Collect It)</h2>
            <p>
                We collect and use Consumer Health Data for one primary purpose: <strong>to operate, maintain, and

            <ul>
                <li>Powering the AI agents (MyThri, Logistics Agent, Connection Agent) so they can provide you with
                    relevant support, reminders, and prompts.</li>
                <li>Allowing you to track and manage caregiving information effectively.</li>
                <li>Personalizing your experience to make the service as helpful as possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Categories of Third Parties With Whom We Share Data</h2>

                We do not sell your Consumer Health Data. We only share it with the following categories of third
                parties who are essential to providing our service:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share data with companies that provide technical
                    infrastructure for our Platform, such as cloud hosting services (e.g., Amazon Web Services). These
                    providers are contractually bound to protect your data and cannot use it for their own purposes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not share your data with data brokers or any other third parties for marketing or advertising
                purposes.</p>
